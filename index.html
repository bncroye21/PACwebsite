			For my project I compared different songs and themes from the Performing Arts Company's Fall 2017 Big Show and their Spring 2018 Big Show.  I used Word Wanderer to create images of the most common words that connected the lyrics that brought out the meaning of the song.  For the Fall 2017 section I linked videos to the dances performed or the song if a video of the dance was not available.  For the Spring 2018 I left it blank as the show has not been put on quite yet.  I organized and compared these songs by four different groups: Fall vs Spring, Fall vs Fall, Spring vs Spring, and Separate.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Fall vs Spring Shows/Pieces</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Fall</b>: If I Had a Boat & <b>Spring</b>: I Wanna Love That Man</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These two pieces talk about being in love with someone but they both have different sounds behind them.  If I Had a Boat is a sad, depressed contemporary piece while I Wanna Love That Man is a upbeat and happy 20's style jazz song.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li><b>Fall</b>: Loney, Show Me Where You Fit/Retrograde & <b>Spring</b>: Silhouettes, Survive</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These four pieces talk about being an outsider in today's world.  The theme of being in someones shadow instead of being your own.  They also talk about making the most of life and not just "surviving."</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li><b>Fall</b>: Hounds of Love & <b>Spring</b>: Paralyzed, Never Knock, Let's Hurt Tonight</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These four pieces all have the same theme of being in love and having strong feelings but struggling and having to power through it all.  It's about being desperate for this feeling and when it comes it's hard.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li><b>Fall</b>: CRZY, Freedom, River & <b>Spring</b>: 6 Inch Heels, I Put a Spell On You</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These five songs all have the theme of empowerment.</li>  
			</ul>
			<br>
		</ul>
		<h2>Fall vs Fall Pieces</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Comes and Goes, Waves, Way Down We Go, If I Had A Boat</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These four songs all have to do with a desperate love but no longer having it.  They talk about failed love but being ok.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>CRZY, Ready or Not Here I Come, River</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These three songs all have to do with empowerment.  They talk about taking over and taking your place in the world.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Show Me Where You Fit, Lonely</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These two songs talk about being an outcast in the world and feeling alone.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>Spring vs Spring Pieces</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Release Your Problems, Never Knock, Paralyzed, Survive, I'll Keep You Safe</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These five songs have to with dealing with issues and learning to power through them whether it be love or self-esteem or other's.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>That Man, Band the Drum All Day</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>These two songs are very happy.  They talk about enjoying life whether it be in love or just playing the drums!</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>Separate</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Freedom</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about the Black Lives Matter movement and African American empowerment.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Human</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about aliens taken over the human body to destroy the world.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>6" Heels</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about female empowerment and taking over; stealing guys attention.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Paralyzed</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about being paralyzed by such strong feelings.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>Me and the Devil</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about selling your soul to the devil.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>About as Helpful as You Can Be Without Being Any Help at All</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about always learning even if you have to start from scratch.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li>House of the Rising Sun</li>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>This song is about the Salem Witch Trials and creepiness.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>
			Overall, the theme of love and strangeness have been shown in both shows together and separate.  The Fall 2017 Big Show had the most songs about love in the show.  The Spring 2018 Big Show had the most diversity in the songs with themes.
